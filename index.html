            <p>While Artificial Intelligence has been mostly positive. There also are some negative impacts of
                Artificial Intelligence. A negative impact of AI is AI Bias. Another negative impact of AI has been
                persons losing their jobs. Also, AI has caused a shift in the human experience. AI has also caused
                global regulations. AI has also accelerated the crime of hacking. There is even AI terrorism.
            </p>
            <p>Whilst there are many different positive impacts of AI we need to focus on the negatives also because
                the negative has great impacts also. AI also has a lack of transparency and explainability. AI also allows
                for ethical dilemmas. AI also increases the potential for human laziness.
